Simple application to sell a house

The next set of changes hopefully tonight I'll add in the ability to place an offer on a house. Currently only a limited ability to add a property exists. Most of the time was spent getting MS SQL to behave on my PC. Created a few stor procs to allow properties to be added and the usual create table scripts. You'd need to go into the dal and amend the connection string to your own server to view.
